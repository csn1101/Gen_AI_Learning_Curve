    "- For one single observation there can be manu input values , suppose 'age of a person' , a single feature , this will be passed on to the neuron as separate\n",
    "  separate independent variables.\n",
    "- These output values can be continuous , binary or categorical.\n",
    "- In secnarios of categorical output variable , the output values will be multiple in numbers just like multiple input value for a single observation\n",
    "- Once input value gets passed on to the neuron , the neuron enables the activation function to generate the output value\n",
